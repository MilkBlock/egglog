# egglog-backend

This is the repo for the database-like backend to [`egglog`](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog).

You can use the existing egglog [Zulip](https://egraphs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/375765-egglog) chat to ask questions and suggest improvements to this repo.

This crate is not on crates.io yet. Until then, we recommend using a [git dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories) in a `Cargo.toml` file, or else building from source.
